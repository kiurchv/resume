    "summary": "I am a polyglot software engineer, with a passion for solving complex problems and a deep grasp of the mechanics behind them.\n\nThroughout my career, I have worked across various domains, taking on roles ranging from a regular engineer to a team's technical lead.\n\nI have experience with many programming languages and technologies, but I am always open to new things. My commercial experience is mainly in the web-related field, but I also love to tinker with low-level tasks – either in my day-to-day tasks or in the myriad of my pet projects.\n\nIt's crucial for me to address real-world challenges, especially those that bring tangible value to society or the industry. For me, every detail of the work process matters, and I prefer a comprehensive approach to problem-solving, taking responsibility for every step - from analyzing the problem to delivering the solution.\n\nI am business-oriented and always strive to transform complex problems into simple, straightforward solutions in the most balanced and reliable manner, ensuring they align perfectly with the organizational structure, product goals, and customer needs.\n\nFurthermore, I pay significant attention to the working process. It is essential for me to maintain a high developer experience for my teammates, continuously supporting their growth and mentoring them, thereby ensuring the highest productivity for the entire team.",
